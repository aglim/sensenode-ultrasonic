sensenode-ultrasonic
====================

This is a driver for Ultrasonic Sensor of Sensenode platform by Genetlab as original one, shipped together with platform is not functioning.

Sensenode based on msp430, thus low-level code is written according to its specification (precisely, msp430f1611). Original documentation and intuition will be provided.

Driver can easily be adopted for other platforms based on msp430, only pin adaptation will be needed. Source codes can also give an idea for drivers for plaforms with different MCU.  

"How to use" and other details coming soon.
